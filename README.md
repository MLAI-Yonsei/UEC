# Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution

This repository contains PyTorch implemenations of "Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution" <!--[paper](.)-->.

## Introduction
Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC) is a framework for combining embeddings in principled, uncertainty-aware manner. UEC consists of three key components.

1. post-hoc conversion of deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones via
Laplace approximation
2. Gaussian convolution with uncertainty-aware weights
3. uncertainty-aware similarity scoring
